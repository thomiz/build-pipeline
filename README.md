# FHIR build pipeline

 The main goal of this guide is to show how you can generate an implementation guide from FHIR-profiles and other conformance resources defined for your FHIR project. The implementation guide should document how to implement a client and/or a server that is to integrate to your FHIR implementation and what semantic requirements the client/server should conform to.  

 ![FHIR Build Workflow](igs/FHIRbuild/input/images/workflow.png)  

**Profiling** To make a FHIR implementation guide you first have to define the conformance resources that defines the semantic rules of you implementation. This step is called [Profiling](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/profiling.html) and usually produce a number for FHIR conformance resources either in the form of XML/JSON or SUSHI FSH files.  

**Documenting** To make an Implementation Guide readable for humans you have to explain the use-case(s) your implementation implements and how the conformance resources are used to achieve interoperability supporting the use-case(s). This step is called documenting and the end result is usually a number of assets descriping the problem and their solution using your implementation. The assets are usually images and text that can be structured into a human readable document.  

**Generating** To generate the actual FHIR implementation guide the FHIR tooling can generate static html pages that consists of all you conformance resources and all the documentation generated in the Documenting step. The end result is a number of html pages that can be published on the internet.

**Hosting** The finished implementation guide generated in the last step can be hosted on you preferred web hosting site. The generated FHIR package should be published in the [FHIR package registry](https://registry.fhir.org/)


## Running IG-publisher as a Github-workflow

When we set up a build environment using Github-workflow we make a yaml script that uses several prebuilt tools to build the implementation-guide and deploying this to a github-pages environment for publication. We use a HL7 generated docker image containing the FHIR build pipeline that handles any FHIR conformance resources for building a FHIR implementation guide.

### Setup a CI GitHub workflow

To use this build pipeline you have to make a script to run the IG-publisher and other necessarry jobs to build and deploy the Implementation Guide.

### IG build yaml script


## Running IG-publisher as a local docker image

Alternatively to running the IG-publisher as a Github-Workflow you can install it locally and run it on your own hardware.

To run the Docker images, install Docker, a personal license should suffice.
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

### Build Docker image

Build a docker image using the vscode task or command-line:

~~~bash
docker build -t [your docker image name here] .
~~~

The docker image settings is contained in the "Dockerfile" configuration file of the repo. The docker file defines how to build a docker image to run the FHIR validator, IG Publishing and SUSHI, including all dependencies. An alternative to run docker is to install these applications on your local computer, but it is easier to maintain a docker image with all dependencies installed.

### Setup your GitHub repo

You will need a gh-pages branch to contain the files produced from you IG build process.  
Goto the Settings->Pages, choose none and press "choose a theme", commit the autogenerated README.md (or edit it first).

>If you add github pages to your repo you have to: 
Choose a theme AND commit the README.md file that is autogenerated by github if Github is to make a separate **gh-pages** branch in your repo.  After this you only have to make the result of the build process available in the gh-pages branch to make this work.

Clone the gh-pages branch to a catalog on your local drive (e.g. "gh-pages") and clone the master branches to a separate directory locally (e.g. "master"). The "gh-pages" catalog is where you store all the files from the IG-generation "output" directory. The "master" directory is where you develop and store the artifacts for your IG and the directory that you point IG-publisher for input files to generate the IG.

### Make an ImplementationGuide

In a separate folder under "igs", define your IG and the FHIR artifacts (profiles, extensions etc.). Artifacts goes in the input folder.  FHIR artifacts can be converted from xml/json to FSH or written by hand using the FSH language.

You need three files to get started with IG build process:
* ig.ini - Defines the template for the IG and where the generated ImplementationGuide resouces is to be found.
* sushi-config.yaml - Defines configuration for your implementation guide to the SUSHI IG generation part of the IG-Publisher
* input/pages/index.md - The starting page of your implementation guide, usually written i markdown

The actual FHIR definitions goes into the fsh folder, full writeup of the catalog structure for [IG-generation](https://fshschool.org/docs/sushi/project/#ig-projects):
* input/fsh/* - All the fsh files defining your FHIR artifacts (profiles, search parameters, codesystems etc.)

XML or JSON input is placed in the input folder with [appropriate folder names](https://build.fhir.org/ig/FHIR/ig-guidance/using-templates.html#igroot-input)  

### Run SUSHI

To generate an ImplementationGuide.json and a menu.xml file for IG-publisher you need to rund SUSHI. Any fsh artifacts will also be generated an placed in the fsh-generated directory as a result of this run.

~~~bash
docker run --rm -v e:\GitRepo\test-IG\master\igs\test-IG:/data thomiz/fhir-build sushi /data
~~~

After the first run, the IG-publisher will update the ImplementationGuide.json file for you, but you can not run the IG-publisher the first time around without an ImplementationGuide Resource definition.

### Run the IG-publisher

When you have created the necessary files you can run the IG-publisher to generate an actual implementation guide.

~~~bash
docker run -it --rm -v package-cache:/root/.fhir -v [ig directory]:/data [name of docker image] publisher -ig /data/ig.ini
~~~

### Publish the IG

The contents in the "output" folder can be copied into the "gh-pages" folder. As soon as the contents is checked in to the GitHub repo you should have a IG page published on your github.io site.
